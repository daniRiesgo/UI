                <h2>THE DRUMS</h2>
                <p>
                    Jazz required a method of playing percussion different
                    from traditional European styles, one that was easily
                    adaptable to the different rhythms of the new genre,
                    fostering the creation of jazz drumming's hybrid technique.
                    As each period in the evolution of jazz—swing and bebop,
                    for example—tended to have its own rhythmic style, jazz
                    drumming continued to evolve along with the music through
                    the 20th century. One tendency that emerged over time was
                    the gradual "freeing" of the beat. But older styles persisted
                    in later periods. The borders between these periods are
                    unclear, partly because no one style completely replaced
                    others, and partly because there were numerous cross
                    influences between styles.

                <h2>THE SAX</h2>
                <p>
                    The saxophone is also commonly used in jazz music,
                    where the saxophone is one of the signature sounds.
                    Beginning in the early 20th century, the saxophone
                    became popular in dance orchestras, which were not
                    jazz ensembles but influenced the format of the big
                    swing era bands that were soon to follow. The arrival
                    of the saxophone as a jazz instrument is attributed
                    to tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins' stint with the
                    Fletcher Henderson Orchestra starting in 1923. The
                    saxophone was soon embraced by Chicago style musicians
                    who added it, along with chordal instruments such as
                    a piano, banjo, or guitar, to the
                    trumpet-clarinet-trombone-bass-drums ensemble format
                    inherited from New Orleans Jazz.

                <h2>THE PIANO</h2>
                <p>
                    Jazz piano (the technique) and the instrument itself
                    offer soloists an exhaustive number of choices. One
                    may play the bass register in an ostinato pattern,
                    popular in boogie-woogie style, where the left hand
                    repeats a phrase numerous times throughout a song,
                    as performed by Rob Agerbeek in "Boogie Woogie Stomp."
                    The left hand can also be played as a melodic counterline
                    that emulates the walking of an upright bass. In stride
                    piano, (similar to the earlier ragtime) the left hand
                    rapidly plays alternate positions between notes in the
                    bass register and chords in the tenor register, while
                    the right hand plays melody and improvises, as performed
                    in George Gershwin's "Liza".
