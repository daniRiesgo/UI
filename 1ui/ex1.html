                               Jazz required a method of playing percussion different
                               from traditional European styles, one that was easily
                               adaptable to the different rhythms of the new genre,
                               fostering the creation of jazz drumming's hybrid technique.
                               As each period in the evolution of jazz—swing and bebop,
                               for example—tended to have its own rhythmic style, jazz
                               drumming continued to evolve along with the music through
                               the 20th century. One tendency that emerged over time was
                               the gradual "freeing" of the beat. But older styles persisted
                               in later periods. The borders between these periods are
                               unclear, partly because no one style completely replaced
                               others, and partly because there were numerous cross
                               influences between styles.

                                  The saxophone is also commonly used in jazz music,
                                  where the saxophone is one of the signature sounds.
                                  Beginning in the early 20th century, the saxophone
                                  became popular in dance orchestras, which were not
                                  jazz ensembles but influenced the format of the big
                                  swing era bands that were soon to follow. The arrival
                                  of the saxophone as a jazz instrument is attributed
                                  to tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins' stint with the
                                  Fletcher Henderson Orchestra starting in 1923. The
                                  saxophone was soon embraced by Chicago style musicians
                                  who added it, along with chordal instruments such as
                                  a piano, banjo, or guitar, to the
                                  trumpet-clarinet-trombone-bass-drums ensemble format
                                  inherited from New Orleans Jazz.

                                  Jazz piano (the technique) and the instrument itself
                                  offer soloists an exhaustive number of choices. One
                                  may play the bass register in an ostinato pattern,
                                  popular in boogie-woogie style, where the left hand
                                  repeats a phrase numerous times throughout a song,
                                  as performed by Rob Agerbeek in "Boogie Woogie Stomp."
                                  The left hand can also be played as a melodic counterline
                                  that emulates the walking of an upright bass. In stride
                                  piano, (similar to the earlier ragtime) the left hand
                                  rapidly plays alternate positions between notes in the
                                  bass register and chords in the tenor register, while
                                  the right hand plays melody and improvises, as performed
                                  in George Gershwin's "Liza".
