                            Jazz required a method of playing percussion different
                            from traditional European styles, one that was easily
                            adaptable to the different rhythms of the new genre,
                            fostering the creation of jazz drumming's hybrid technique.
                            As each period in the evolution of jazz—swing and bebop,
                            for example—tended to have its own rhythmic style, jazz
                            drumming continued to evolve along with the music through
                            the 20th century. One tendency that emerged over time was
                            the gradual "freeing" of the beat. But older styles persisted
                            in later periods. The borders between these periods are
                            unclear, partly because no one style completely replaced
                            others, and partly because there were numerous cross
                            influences between styles.

                            The saxophone is also commonly used in jazz music,
                            where the saxophone is one of the signature sounds.
                            Beginning in the early 20th century, the saxophone
                            became popular in dance orchestras, which were not
                            jazz ensembles but influenced the format of the big
                            swing era bands that were soon to follow. The arrival
                            of the saxophone as a jazz instrument is attributed
                            to tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins' stint with the
                            Fletcher Henderson Orchestra starting in 1923. The
                            saxophone was soon embraced by Chicago style musicians
                            who added it, along with chordal instruments such as
                            a piano, banjo, or guitar, to the
                            trumpet-clarinet-trombone-bass-drums ensemble format
                            inherited from New Orleans Jazz.

                            Jazz piano (the technique) and the instrument itself
                            offer soloists an exhaustive number of choices. One
                            may play the bass register in an ostinato pattern,
                            popular in boogie-woogie style, where the left hand
                            repeats a phrase numerous times throughout a song,
                            as performed by Rob Agerbeek in "Boogie Woogie Stomp."
                            The left hand can also be played as a melodic counterline
                            that emulates the walking of an upright bass. In stride
                            piano, (similar to the earlier ragtime) the left hand
                            rapidly plays alternate positions between notes in the
                            bass register and chords in the tenor register, while
                            the right hand plays melody and improvises, as performed
                            in George Gershwin's "Liza".
